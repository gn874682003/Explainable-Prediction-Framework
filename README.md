# FCPM: Explainable and Effective Process Remaining Time Prediction Using Feature-informed Cascade Prediction Model
A notebook illustrating the training mechanism and structure of the FCPM proposed in the paper. 

Download the project package and run the "main.py" file on your local machine to start execution. This code can perform the next tasks:

* Training a remaining time prediction model using an event log in CSV format as input. The event log file should be stored in the Dataset folder in advance. The model was built using torch (1.10.0). 
* Execuse pre-processing, feature selection and feature coding before model training.
* Predict the remaining time of an incomplete business process trace.
